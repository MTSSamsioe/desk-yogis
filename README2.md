# Bugs
   
## Solved Bugs
- The footer with the contact section did not show on the other pages only index.html
    - Fix: I did not import the script from font awsome on the other pages. And because the contact section consist only of icons it did not show anything.
- I couldnÂ´t get the iframes to the you tube videos to show anything:
    - Fix: I inserted the url to the you tube clip in the src="" atribute but I later realized that I had to paste the entire imbeded code from the "Share" function on you tube 
- The wrapper for the text section on index.html was either to long or to short for its content
    - Fix: I contacted a CI tutor and he said to add display: flex ; to the wrapper and height 100% to the divs inside to make it the same height and responsive
