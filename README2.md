# DESK YOGIS

Deskyogis.com is a site for people who spend several hours per day sitting still in front of a screen.
Site visitors will find exercises for both body and mind. 
Yoga exercises for the body that can be preformed sitting down at a desk.
And guided meditations for the mind that also can be preformed sitting at a desk.

To have both guided meditations and yoga exercises on the sam page creates value to the visitor and helps the visitor to make the most of their breaks at work.

# Testing
- The site is tested so it is looks good in different browsers such as: Safari, Chrome and Fire fox
- All internal links are tested and all external links are tested so that they opens in new tabs
- The sign up form is tested so that it only accepts a correct email adress
- Responsiveness:
    - I have confirmed that the all pages are responsive on all standard screens using dev tools device toolbar
    - Index.html and exercises.html have their pictures that belong to the text to the right. When screen width goes under 950px they all become block elements instead and show underneath each other.
    - The header with navigation will show the nav-links underneath the page title when the screen is under 950px. Instead of to the right on wider screens

# Bugs
   
## Solved Bugs
- The footer with the contact section did not show on the other pages, only index.html
    - Fix: I did not import the script from fontawsome.com on the other pages. And because the contact section consist only of icons it did not show anything.
- I couldnÂ´t get the iframes of the Youtube videos to show anything:
    - Fix: I inserted the url to the Youtube clip in the src="" attribute but I later realized that I had to paste the entire imbeded code from the "Share" function on Youtube 
- The wrapper for the text section on index.html was either too long or too short for its content
    - Fix: I contacted a CI tutor and he said to add display: flex ; to the wrapper and height 100% to the divs inside to make it the same height and responsive
